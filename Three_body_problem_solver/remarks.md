# Remarks

A simple program that solves the Three Body Problem in physics and then displays it to the screen
More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem

## Warnings

- Epilepsy warning
- If you are a person who enjoys the readability of python code I strongly urge you to look away
- You might get blacklisted by FAANG for viewing the code
- Strong chance of you losing your sanity after reading this code

## Usage

Simply run the main.py file  

### Compatibility

- Make sure your current working directory is in the "Three_body_problem_solver" folder when you run main.py, if your current working directory isn't in the folder then it won't work
- Tested and works for Python versions 3.12.4 to 3.12.11, but should work in any 3.12 version
- Tested and works on Windows using Windows PowerShell, Pycharm, or VSCode IDE's, it should also work on Linux and macOS, however when ran on Ubuntu it wasn't working

## Additional Features

- Made the code so dense it has its own gravitational pull
- Comments on the outside as well as on the inside of the code for additional readability
- In detail comments that make the code easy to understand
- I like turtles
- Only used chr() for the % symbol and for \ if the user is on Linux or macOS
- Changing the folder name breaks the code if ran on Windows
- Black listed from all FAANG companies now
- All the data is stored in the cat comment
- main.py when ran opens itself up and reads itself as a text file to get variable data
- Multiple undeclared variables and functions that for some reason work
- If code fails, it doesn't give up
- My coding professor won't talk to me anymore
